# TicTacToeGame
My first ever project as I have completed my Advance Java Course. I have created a TicTacToe game using Java Swing. Various Java Swing components are used for creating this game such as JButton, JTextField, etc. Accordingly the data of the winning player is also saved in a text file using FileOutputStream.
